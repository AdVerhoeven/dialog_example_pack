# dialog_example_pack
A datapack that shows some of the powers of dialogs, made for Minecraft version 1.21.10+

## This pack is experimental
This datapack is a personal experimental project. I use it to both see what can be done with these dialogs and to continuously improve it. This can mean that I rename folders and change/remove functions that, which in turn could break some of the existing dialogs.

Besides the pack itself being very volatile, Mojang is clear on their stance that Dialogs are still experimental and bound to change.

## Contents
Most functionality can be accessed through dialogs under the pause menu and/or quick actions (default keybind "G")

## Demo
To demonstrate its power I also added a function to summon in some mannequins to double as "players". Use "/function essentials:demo/spawn_nonplayers" this will spawn the 9 default skin mannequins with the names matching the skin name. They should work similarly to players when using the various "commands". 

For more demo functions you can open the demo dialog, this does require elevated permission levels unlike most other dialogs.
