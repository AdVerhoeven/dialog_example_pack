# dialog_example_pack
A datapack that shows some of the powers of dialogs, made for Minecraft version 1.21.10+

## Installation
Download the repository as a zip. In the downloaded archive the actual datapack and resourcepack are located inside the build folder.

## This pack is experimental
This datapack is a personal experimental project. I use it to both see what can be done with these dialogs and to continuously improve it. This can mean that I rename folders and change/remove functions a lot, which in turn could break some of the existing dialogs.

Besides the pack itself being very volatile, Mojang is clear on their stance that Dialogs are still experimental and bound to change.

## Contents
Most functionality can be accessed through dialogs under the pause menu and/or quick actions (default keybind "G")

## Demo
To demonstrate its power I also added a function to summon in some mannequins to double as "players". Use `/function essentials:demo/spawn_nonplayers` this will spawn the 9 default skin mannequins with the names matching the skin name. They should work similarly to players when using the various commands and dialogs. 

The demo functions do require elevated permission levels (server op in vanilla) to be used.
