# dialog_example_pack
A datapack that shows some of the powers of dialogs, made for Minecraft version 1.21.10

To avoid the pop-up when loading a new world you have to remove the dialog folder(s) from the pack. The inline dialogs will still work.

A basic TPA and TPAHERE like action menu has been added to the quick_actions (Default bind is "G", see your minecraft control settings)

To demonstrate its power I also added a function to summon in some mannequins to double as "players". Use "/function essentials:demo/spawn_nonplayers" this will spawn the 9 default skin mannequins with the names matching the skin name. They should work similarly to players when using the various "commands".
